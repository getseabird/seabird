# Seabird

Seabird is a native cross-platform Kubernetes desktop client that makes it super
easy to explore your cluster's resources. We aim to visualize all common
resource types in a simple, bloat-free user interface.

Builds are currently available for Linux and Windows. Note that this is
**alpha** quality software with missing features and bugs.

## Requirements

Seabird requires libadwaita (>1.4) and gtksourceview 5 to run. The Windows
builds include all dependencies.

#### Fedora

```
sudo dnf install libadwaita gtksourceview5
```

#### Debian

```
sudo apt install libadwaita-1 libgtksourceview-5
```

Note: Releases older than Debian Trixie or Ubuntu Mantic are not supported.
Please use the Flatpak instead.
